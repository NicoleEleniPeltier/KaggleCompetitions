My solutions to challenges shared by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)

## [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
**Goal**: Predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived given the passenger's age, sex, passenger class, and other features. My solution did not compare particularly well to other submissions, but it was an enjoyable first Kaggle competition as I got to practice my skills.

My solution incorporates:
- Data visualization
- Feature engineering
- Logistic regression

Key libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
